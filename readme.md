### Arngreen
Arngreen is an use item advertisment website . From just the main page i can said its realy confusing the people who visits that website :tw-1f605:

<br> ![Arngreen](asset/arngreen1.png) <br>

there are so much item on a singgle page with untidy arrangement . and there are also an unpolite advertisement without age restriction and agreement frist

<br> ![Arngreen](asset/arngreen2.png) <br>
when i click on an advertisement to see the detail product . i became even more confused :tw-1f629: there are a lot of advertisement inside and even its an e-commerce website even though its hard to find how could i buy this item

**solution**
1. for the solution i think they must arrange the item so we could easily find how to buy that item and than please remove unpolite advertisement
2. on a detail product they should make one page for one advertisement

### Windows Store
Windows store is an aplication from microsoft for user to install aplication/game with free or paid
